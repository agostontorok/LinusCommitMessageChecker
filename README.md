# The gamified git hook to check commit messages. [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/agostontorok/LinusCommitMessageChecker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/agostontorok/LinusCommitMessageChecker)

![demo](asciicast.gif)

Features:

* Stops you ever accidentally committing bad temporary changes.
* Is gamified, collect XPs for nice commit messages and get reprimand when you write wrong ones.
* Installs in any project with a single command
* Is easily extendable and custom themes can be added (the v0.2.2 is in GoT style, v1.0 is in the style of Linus Torwalds)
* Is well tested. See [tests/test-hook.bats](https://github.com/pimterry/git-confirm/blob/master/test/test-hook.bats#L40-L9999).
* Works on Linux, OSX and Windows ([in Powershell at least](https://twitter.com/afnpires/status/768403583263973376)).
* It is based on the wonderful [git confirm by Tim Perry](https://github.com/pimterry/git-confirm/)
